A bunch of fun custom commands for your terminal, especially the Zsh shell.<br/>

## Getting Started
Depending on your shell configuration, the set up is mostly the same but only with some minor changes. <br/>
It's all pretty simple stuff, so feel free to customize it however you like!

1. Download the commands file from this repo.
2. Make a hidden folder at your home directory.
    - `mkdir ~/.commands`
3. Put the commands file into said folder.
    - `mv commands ~/.commands`
4. Put the following line in your .rc file (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc or whatever depending on your config):
    - `. ~/.commands/commands`
5. Start a new terminal session, and enjoy!

## Currently Supported Commands
<strong>Note:</strong> Make your own functions within the commands file! Customize them as much as you like.<br/>
